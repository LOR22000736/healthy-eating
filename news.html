        <p>New research being presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Venice, Italy (12-15 May) has explored the benefits of giving personalized doses of semaglutide to patients taking part in a weight loss programme and tapering them off the medication when they reach their target weight. The study is by researchers at Embla, a digital weight loss clinic based in both Copenhagen, Denmark and London, UK, led by Dr Henrik Gudbergsen, the lead researcher and Embla's Chief Medical Officer.</p>

        <p>It found that lower doses were just as effective as higher doses and that slowly reducing medication while focusing on lifestyle changes prevents weight regain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide are highly effective at helping people lose weight. By mimicking the action of a hormone called GLP-1, they reduce appetite and feelings of hunger, slow the release of food from the stomach and increase feelings of fullness after eating.</p>

        <p>However, they can cause side-effects such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and headaches and many patients quickly regain much of the weight they have lost after they stop taking the medication.</p>

        <p>Recent research, however, indicates that patients who receive nutrition and exercise coaching and support tackling issues linked to emotional eating, for example, alongside their weight-loss medication, are less likely to regain weight. Some studies also indicate that coming off the medication slowly may help prevent weight regain.</p>

        <p>The researchers at Embla were interested in whether it was possible to tailor dosage of semaglutide to minimize side-effects, while still achieving weight loss. They also wanted to know if patients who tapered off semaglutide, by slowly reducing their dose to zero, regained weight after coming off it completely.</p>
